# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Fi
**Date:** 2026-01-02T18:48:56Z

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Creating a SeleniumBase learning platform from video content
**Goals:** Create an interactive tutorial platform with hands-on exercises

### Context Guidance

Based on the 44 SeleniumBase videos in spec.md, this brainstorming session will explore innovative approaches to transform video tutorials into an engaging, hands-on learning experience.

### Session Setup

We're focusing on transforming the extensive SeleniumBase video playlist (44 videos covering fundamentals, UC mode, CDP mode, recorder, dashboard and more) into an interactive learning platform. The goal is to create practical, hands-on exercises that help learners master SeleniumBase through active engagement rather than passive watching.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** User-Selected Techniques
**Selected Techniques:**

- **SCAMPER Method**: Systematic creativity through seven lenses (Substitute/Combine/Adapt/Modify/Put to other uses/Eliminate/Reverse) - Perfect for exploring different approaches to creating an interactive SeleniumBase learning platform and generating systematic ideas for transforming video content into hands-on exercises.

**Selection Rationale:** SCAMPER Method was chosen because it provides a structured framework for systematically exploring all aspects of the SeleniumBase learning platform challenge. This technique will help generate diverse ideas by examining the platform through seven different lenses, ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential solutions and approaches.
